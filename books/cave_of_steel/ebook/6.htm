<p class="nonindent">Police Commissioner Julius Enderby polished his glasses with exquisite care and placed them upon the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley thought: It’s a good trick. Keeps you busy while you’re thinking what to say, and it doesn’t cost money the way lighting up a pipe does.</p>
<p class="indent">And because the thought had entered his mind, he drew out his pipe and dipped into his pinched store of rough-cut. One of the few luxury crops still grown on Earth was tobacco, and its end was visibly approaching. Prices had gone up, never down, in Baley’s lifetime; quotas down, never up.</p>
<p class="indent">Enderby, having adjusted his glasses, felt for the switch at one end of his desk and flicked his door into one-way transparency for a moment. “Where is he now, by the way?”</p>
<p class="indent">“He told me he wanted to be shown through the Department, and I let Jack Tobin do the honors.” Baley lit his pipe and tightened its baffle carefully. The Commissioner, like most non-indulgers, was petty about tobacco smoke.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page83"/>“I hope you didn’t tell him Daneel was a robot.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Of course I didn’t.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Commissioner did not relax. One hand remained aimlessly busy with the automatic calendar on his desk.</p>
<p class="indent">“How is it?” he asked, without looking at Baley. “Middling rough.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m sorry, Lije.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley said, firmly, “You might have warned me that he looked completely human.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Commissioner looked surprised. “I didn’t?” Then, with sudden petulance, “Damn it, you should have known. I wouldn’t have asked you to have him stay at your house if he looked like R. Sammy. Now would I?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I know, Commissioner, but I’d never seen a robot like that and you had. I didn’t even know such things were possible. I just wished you’d mentioned it, that’s all.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Look, Lije, I’m sorry. I should have told you. You’re right. It’s just that this job, this whole deal, has me so on edge that half the time I’m just snapping at people for no reason. He, I mean this Daneel thing, is a new-type robot. It’s still in the experimental stage.”</p>
<p class="indent">“So he explained himself.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Oh. Well, that’s it, then.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley tensed a little. This was it, now. He said, casually, teeth clenched on pipestem, “R. Daneel has arranged a trip to Spacetown for me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“To Spacetown!” Enderby looked up with instant indignation.</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes. It’s the logical next move, Commissioner. I’d like to see the scene of the crime, ask a few questions.”</p>
<p class="indent">Enderby shook his head decidedly. “I don’t think that’s a good idea, Lije. We’ve gone over the ground. I doubt there’s anything new to be learned. And they’re <a id="page84"/>strange people. Kid gloves! They got to be handled with kid gloves. You don’t have the experience.”</p>
<p class="indent">He put a plump hand to his forehead and added, with unexpected fervor, “I hate them.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley inserted hostility into his voice. “Damn it, the robot came here and I should go there. It’s bad enough sharing a front seat with a robot; I hate to take a back seat. Of course, if you don’t think I’m capable of running this investigation, Commissioner—”</p>
<p class="indent">“It isn’t that, Lije. It’s not you, it’s the Spacers. You don’t know what they’re like.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley deepened his frown, “Well, then, Commissioner, suppose you come along.” His right hand rested on his knee, and two of his fingers crossed automatically as he said that.</p>
<p class="indent">The Commissioner’s eyes widened. “No, Lije. I won’t go there. Don’t ask me to.” He seemed visibly to catch hold of his runaway words. More quietly, he said, with an unconvincing smile, “Lots of work here, you know. I’m days behind.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley regarded him thoughtfully. “I tell you what, then. Why not get into it by trimension later on. Just for a while, you understand. In case I need help.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Well, yes. I suppose I can do that.” He sounded unenthusiastic.</p>
<p class="indent">“Good.” Baley looked at the wall clock, nodded, and got up. “I’ll be in touch with you.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley looked back as he left the office, keeping the door open for part of an additional second. He saw the Commissioner’s head begin bending down toward the crook of one elbow as it rested on the desk. The plain-clothes man could almost swear he heard a sob.</p>
<p class="indent">Jehoshaphat! he thought, in outright shock.</p>
<p class="indent">He paused in the common room and sat on the corner of a nearby desk, ignoring its occupant, who <a id="page85"/>looked up, murmured a casual greeting, and returned to his work.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley unclipped the baffle from the bowl of the pipe and blew into it. He inverted the pipe itself over the desk’s small ash vacuum and let the powdery white tobacco ash vanish. He looked regretfully at the empty pipe, readjusted the baffle, and put it away. Another pipeful gone forever!</p>
<p class="indent">He reconsidered what had just taken place. In one way, Enderby had not surprised him. He had expected resistance to any attempt on his own part to enter Spacetown. He had learned the Commissioner talk often enough about the difficulties of dealing with Spacers, about the dangers of allowing any but experienced negotiators to have anything to do with them, even over trifles.</p>
<p class="indent">He had not expected, however, to have the Commissioner give in so easily. He had supposed, at the very least, that Enderby would have insisted on accompanying him. The pressure of other work was meaningless in the face of the importance of this problem.</p>
<p class="indent">And that was not what Baley wanted. He wanted exactly what he had gotten. He wanted the Commissioner to be present by trimensional personification so that he could witness the proceedings from a point of safety.</p>
<p class="indent">Safety was the key word. Baley would need a witness that could not be put out of the way immediately. He needed that much as the minimum guarantee of his own safety.</p>
<p class="indent">The Commissioner had agreed to that at once. Baley remembered the parting sob, or ghost of one, and thought: Jehoshaphat, the man’s into this past his depth.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page86"/>A cheerful, slurring voice sounded just at Baley’s shoulder and Baley started.</p>
<p class="indent">“What the devil do you want?” he demanded savagely.</p>
<p class="indent">The smile on R. Sammy’s face remained foolishly fixed. “Jack says to tell you Daneel is ready, Lije.”</p>
<p class="indent">“All right. Now get out of here.”</p>
<p class="indent">He frowned at the robot’s departing back. There was nothing so irritating as having that clumsy metal contraption forever making free with your front name. He’d complained about that when R. Sammy first arrived and the Commissioner had shrugged his shoulders and said, “You can’t have it both ways, Lije. The public insists that City robots be built with a strong friendship circuit. All right, then. He is drawn to you. He calls you the friendliest name he knows.”</p>
<p class="indent">Friendship circuit! No robot built, of any type, could possibly hurt a human being. That was the First Law of Robotics:</p>
<p class="indent">“A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”</p>
<p class="indent">No positronic brain was ever built without that injunction driven so deeply into its basic circuits that no conceivable derangement could displace it. There was no need for specialized friendship circuits.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet the Commissioner was right. The Earthman’s distrust for robots was something quite irrational and friendship circuits had to be incorporated, just as all robots had to be made smiling. On Earth, at any rate.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel, now, never smiled.</p>
<p class="indent">Sighing, Baley rose to his feet. He thought: Spacetown, next stop—or, maybe, last stop!</p>
<p class="extract">   The police forces of the City, as well as certain high officials, could still make use of individual squad <a id="page87"/>cars along the corridors of the City and even along the ancient underground motorways that were barred to foot traffic. There were perennial demands on the part of the Liberals that these motorways be converted to children’s playgrounds, to new shopping areas, or to expressway or localway extensions.</p>
<p class="indent">The strong pleas of “Civic safety!” remained un-vanquished, however. In cases of fires too large to be handled by local devices, in cases of massive breakdowns in power lines or ventilators, most of all in cases of serious riot, there had to be some means whereby the forces of the City could be mobilized at the stricken point in a hurry. No substitute for the motorways existed or could exist.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley had traveled along a motorway several times before in his life, but its indecent emptiness always depressed him. It seemed a million miles from the warm, living pulsation of the City. It stretched out like a blind and hollow worm before his eyes as he sat at the controls of the squad car. It opened continuously into new stretches as he moved around this gentle curve or that. Behind him, he knew without looking, another blind and hollow worm continually contracted and closed. The motorway was well lit, but lighting was meaningless in the silence and emptiness.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel did nothing to break the silence or fill that emptiness. He looked straight ahead, as unimpressed by the empty motorway as by the bulging expressway.</p>
<p class="indent">In one sounding moment, to the tune of a wild whine of the squad car’s siren, they popped out of the motorway and curved gradually into the vehicular lane of a City corridor.</p>
<p class="indent">The vehicular lanes were still conscientiously marked down each major corridor in reverence for one vestigial portion of the past. There were no vehicles <a id="page88"/>any longer, except for squad cars, fire engines, and maintenance trucks, and pedestrians used the lanes in complete self-assurance. They scattered in indignant hurry before the advance of Baley’s squealing car.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley, himself, drew a freer breath as noise surged in about him, but it was an interval only. In less than two hundred yards they turned into the subdued corridors that led to Spacetown Entrance.</p>
<p class="extract">   They were expected. The guards obviously knew R. Daneel by sight and, although themselves human, nodded to him without the least self-consciousness.</p>
<p class="indent">One approached Baley and saluted with perfect, if frigid, military courtesy. He was tall and grave, though not the perfect specimen of Spacer physique that R. Daneel was.</p>
<p class="indent">He said, “Your identification card, if you please, sir.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was inspected quickly but thoroughly. Baley noticed that the guard wore flesh-colored gloves and had an all but unnoticeable filter in each nostril.</p>
<p class="indent">The guard saluted again and returned the card. He said, “There is a small Men’s Personal here which we would be pleased to have you use if you wish to shower.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was in Baley’s mind to deny the necessity, but R. Daneel plucked gently at his sleeve, as the guard stepped back to his place.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel said, “It is customary, partner Elijah, for City dwellers to shower before entering Spacetown. I tell you this since I know you have no desire, through lack of information on this matter, to render yourself or ourselves uncomfortable. It is also advisable for you to attend to any matters of personal hygiene you may think advisable. There will be no facilities within Spacetown for that purpose.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page89"/>“No facilities!” said Baley, strenuously. “But that’s impossible.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I mean, of course,” said R. Daneel, “none for use by City dwellers.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley’s face filled with a clearly hostile astonishment.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel said, “I regret the situation, but it is a matter of custom.”</p>
<p class="indent">Wordlessly, Baley entered the Personal. He felt, rather than saw, R. Daneel entering behind him.</p>
<p class="indent">He thought: Checking on me? Making sure I wash the City dust off myself?</p>
<p class="indent">For a furious moment, he reveled in the thought of the shock he was preparing for Spacetown. It seemed to him suddenly minor that he might, in effect, be pointing a blaster at his own chest.</p>
<p class="indent">The Personal was small, but it was well appointed and antiseptic in its cleanliness. There was a trace of sharpness in the air. Baley sniffed at it, momentarily puzzled.</p>
<p class="indent">Then he thought: Ozone! They’ve got ultraviolet radiation flooding the place.</p>
<p class="indent">A little sign blinked on and off several times, then remained steadily lit. It said, “Visitor will please remove all clothing, including shoes, and place in the receptacle below.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley acquiesced. He unhitched his blaster and blaster strap and recircled it about his naked waist. It felt heavy and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="indent">The receptacle closed and his clothing was gone. The lighted sign blanked out. A new sign flashed ahead.</p>
<p class="indent">It said: “Visitor will please tend to personal needs, then make use of the shower indicated by arrow.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley felt like a machine tool being shaped by long-distance force edges on an assembly line.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page90"/>His first act upon entering the small shower cubicle was to draw up the moisture-proof flap on his blaster holster and clip it down firmly all about. He knew by long-standing test that he could still draw and use it in less than five seconds.</p>
<p class="indent">There was no knob or hook on which to hang his blaster. There was not even a visible shower head. He placed it in a corner away from the cubicle’s entrance door.</p>
<p class="indent">Another sign flashed: “Visitor will please hold arms directly out from his body and stand in the central circle with feet in the indicated positions.”</p>
<p class="indent">As he placed his feet in the small depressions allowed for them, the sign blanked out. As it did so, a stinging, foaming spray hit him from ceiling, floor, and four walls. He felt the water welling up even beneath the soles of his feet. For a full minute it lasted, his skin reddening under the combined force of the heat and pressure and his lungs gasping for air in the warm dampness. There followed another minute of cool, low-pressure spray, and then finally a minute of warm air that left him dry and refreshed.</p>
<p class="indent">He picked up his blaster and blaster strap and found that they, too, were dry and warm. He strapped them on and stepped out of the cubicle in time to see R. Daneel emerge from a neighboring shower. Of course! R. Daneel was not a City dweller, but he had accumulated City dust.</p>
<p class="indent">Quite automatically, Baley looked away. Then, with the thought that, after all, R. Daneel’s customs were not City customs, he forced his unwilling eyes back for one moment. His lips quirked in a tiny smile. R. Daneel’s resemblance to humanity was not restricted to his face and hands but had been carried out with painstaking accuracy over the entire body.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley stepped forward in the direction he had <a id="page91"/>been traveling continuously since entering the Personal. He found his clothes waiting for him, neatly folded. They had a warm, clean odor to them.</p>
<p class="indent">A sign said, “Visitor will please resume his clothing and place his hand in the indicated depression.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley did so. He felt a definite tingling in the ball of his middle finger as he laid it down upon the clean, milky surface. He lifted his hand hastily and found a little drop of blood oozing out. As he watched, it stopped flowing.</p>
<p class="indent">He shook it off and pinched the finger. No more blood was flowing even then.</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously, they were analyzing his blood. He felt a definite pang of anxiety. His own yearly routine examination by Department doctors, he felt sure, was not carried on with the thoroughness or, perhaps, with the knowledge of these cold robot-makers from outer space. He was not sure he wanted too probing an inquiry into the state of his health.</p>
<p class="indent">The time of waiting seemed long to Baley, but when the light flashed again, it said simply, “Visitor will proceed.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley drew a long breath of relief. He walked onward and stepped through an archway. Two metal rods closed in before him and, written in luminous air, were the words: “Visitor is warned to proceed no further.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What the devil—” called out Baley, forgetting in his anger the fact that he was still in the Personal.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel’s voice was in his ear. “The sniffers have detected a power source, I imagine. Are you carrying your blaster, Elijah?”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley whirled, his face a deep <em>crimson</em>. He tried twice, then managed to croak out, “A police officer has his blaster on him or in easy reach at all times, on duty and off.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page92"/>It was the first time he had spoken in a Personal, proper, since he was ten years old. That had been in his uncle Boris’s presence and had merely been an automatic complaint when he stubbed his toe. Uncle Boris had beaten him well when he reached home and had lectured him strongly on the necessities of public decency.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel said, “No visitor may be armed. It is our custom, Elijah. Even your Commissioner leaves his blaster behind on all visits.”</p>
<p class="indent">Under almost any other circumstances, Baley would have turned on his heel and walked away, away from Spacetown and away from that robot. Now, however, he was almost mad with desire to go through with his exact plan and have his revenge to the brim in that way.</p>
<p class="indent">This, he thought, was the unobtrusive medical examination that had replaced the more detailed one of the early days. He could well understand, he could understand to overflowing, the indignation and anger that had led to the Barrier Riots of his youth.</p>
<p class="indent">In black anger, Baley unhitched his blaster belt. R. Daneel took it from him and placed it within a recess in the wall. A thin metal plate slithered across it.</p>
<p class="indent">“If you will put your thumb in the depression,” said R. Daneel, “only your thumb will open it later on.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley felt undressed, far more so, in fact, than he had felt in the shower. He stepped across the point at which the rods had lately barred him, and, finally, out of the Personal.</p>
<p class="indent">He was back in a corridor again, but there was an element of strangeness about it. Up ahead, the light had an unfamiliar quality to it. He felt a whiff of air against his face and, automatically, he thought a squad car had passed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page93"/>R. Daneel must have read his uneasiness in his face. He said, “You are essentially in open air now, Elijah. It is unconditioned.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley felt faintly sick. How could the Spacers be so rigidly careful of a human body, merely because it came from the City, and then breathe the dirty air of the open fields? He tightened his nostrils, as though by pulling them together he could the more effectively screen the ingoing air.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel said, “I believe you will find that open air is not deleterious to human health.”</p>
<p class="indent">“All right,” said Baley, faintly.</p>
<p class="indent">The air currents hit annoyingly against his face. They were gentle enough, but they were erratic. That bothered him.</p>
<p class="indent">Worse came. The corridor opened into blueness and as they approached its end, strong white light washed down. Baley had seen sunlight. He had been in a natural Solarium once in the line of duty. But there, protecting glass had enclosed the place and the sun’s own image had been refracted into a generalized glow. Here, all was open.</p>
<p class="indent">Automatically, he looked up at the sun, then turned away. His dazzled eyes blinked and watered.</p>
<p class="indent">A Spacer was approaching. A moment of misgiving struck Baley.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel, however, stepped forward to greet the approaching man with a handshake. The Spacer turned to Baley and said, “Won’t you come with me, sir? I am Dr. Han Fastolfe.”</p>
<p class="indent">Things were better inside one of the domes. Baley found himself goggling at the size of the rooms and the way in which space was so carelessly distributed, but was thankful for the feel of the conditioned air.</p>
<p class="indent">Fastolfe said, sitting down and crossing his long <a id="page94"/>legs, “I’m assuming that you prefer conditioning to unobstructed wind.”</p>
<p class="indent">He seemed friendly enough. There were fine wrinkles on his forehead and a certain flabbiness to the skin below his eyes and just under his chin. His hair was thinning, but showed no signs of gray. His large ears stood away from his head, giving him a humorous and homely appearance that comforted Baley.</p>
<p class="indent">Early that morning, Baley had looked once again at those pictures of Spacetown that Enderby had taken. R. Daneel had just arranged the Spacetown appointment and Baley was absorbing the notion that he was to meet Spacers in the flesh. Somehow that was considerably different from speaking to them across miles of carrier wave, as he had done on several occasions before.</p>
<p class="indent">The Spacers in those pictures had been, generally speaking, like those that were occasionally featured in the bookfilms: tall, red-headed, grave, coldly handsome. Like R. Daneel Olivaw, for instance.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel named the Spacers for Baley and when Baley suddenly pointed and said in surprise, “That isn’t you, is it?” R. Daneel answered, “No, Elijah, that is my designer, Dr. Sarton.”</p>
<p class="indent">He said it unemotionally.</p>
<p class="indent">“You were made in your maker’s image?” asked Baley, sardonically, but there was no answer to that and, in truth, Baley scarcely expected one. The Bible, as he knew, circulated only to the most limited extent on the Outer Worlds.</p>
<p class="indent">And now Baley looked at Han Fastolfe, a man who deviated very noticeably from the Spacer norm in looks, and the Earthman felt pronounced gratitude for that fact.</p>
<p class="indent">“Won’t you accept food?” asked Fastolfe.</p>
<p class="indent">He indicated the table that separated himself and <a id="page95"/>R. Daneel from the Earthman. It bore nothing but a bowl of varicolored spheroids. Baley felt vaguely startled. He had taken them for table decorations.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel explained. “These are the fruits of natural plant life grown on Aurora. I suggest you try this kind. It is called an apple and is reputed to be pleasant.”</p>
<p class="indent">Fastolfe smiled. “R. Daneel does not know this by personal experience, of course, but he is quite right.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley brought an apple to his mouth. Its surface was red and green. It was cool to the touch and had a faint but pleasant odor. With an effort, he bit into it and the unexpected tartness of the pulpy contents hurt his teeth.</p>
<p class="indent">He chewed it gingerly. City dwellers ate natural food, of course, whenever rations allowed it. He himself had eaten natural meat and bread often. But such food had always been processed in some way. It had been cooked or ground, blended or compounded. Fruit, now, properly speaking, should come in the form of sauce or preserve. What he was holding now must have come straight from the dirt of a planet’s soil.</p>
<p class="indent">He thought: I hope they’ve washed it at least.</p>
<p class="indent">Again he wondered at the spottiness of Spacer notions concerning cleanliness.</p>
<p class="indent">Fastolfe said, “Let me introduce myself a bit more specifically. I am in charge of the investigation of the murder of Dr. Sarton at the Spacetown end as Commissioner Enderby is at the City end. If I can help you in any way, I stand ready to do so. We are as eager for a quiet solution of the affair and prevention of future incidents of the sort as any of you City men can be.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Thank you, Dr. Fastolfe,” said Baley. “Your attitude is appreciated.”</p>
<p class="indent">So much, he thought, for the amenities. He bit into the center of the apple and hard, dark little ovoids <a id="page96"/>popped into his mouth. He spat automatically. They flew out and fell to the ground. One would have struck Fastolfe’s leg had not the Spacer moved it hastily.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley reddened, started to bend.</p>
<p class="indent">Fastolfe said, pleasantly, “It is quite all right, Mr. Baley. Just leave them, please.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley straightened again. He put the apple down gingerly. He had the uncomfortable feeling that once he was gone, the lost little objects would be found and picked up by suction; the bowl of fruit would be burnt or discarded far from Spacetown; the very room they were sitting in would be sprayed with viricide.</p>
<p class="indent">He covered his embarrassment with brusqueness. He said, “I would like to ask permission to have Commissioner Enderby join our conference by trimensional personification.”</p>
<p class="indent">Fastolfe’s eyebrows raised. “Certainly, if you wish it. Daneel, would you make the connection?”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley sat in stiff discomfort until the shiny surface of the large parallelepiped in one corner of the room dissolved away to show Commissioner Julius Enderby and part of his desk. At that moment, the discomfort eased and Baley felt nothing short of love for that familiar figure, and a longing to be safely back in that office with him or anywhere in the City, for that matter. Even in the least prepossessing portion of the Jersey yeast-vat districts.</p>
<p class="indent">Now that he had his witness, Baley saw no reason for delay. He said, “I believe I have penetrated the mystery surrounding the death of Dr. Sarton.”</p>
<p class="indent">Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Enderby springing to his feet and grabbing wildly (and successfully) at his flying spectacles. By standing, the Commissioner thrust his head out of limits of the trimensic receiver and was forced to sit down again, red-faced and speechless.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page97"/>In a much quieter way, Dr. Fastolfe, head inclined to one side, was startled. Only R. Daneel was unmoved.</p>
<p class="indent">“Do you mean,” said Fastolfe, “that you know the murderer?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No,” said Baley, “I mean there was no murder.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What!” screamed Enderby.</p>
<p class="indent">“One moment, Commissioner Enderby,” said Fastolfe, raising a hand. His eyes held Baley’s and he said, “Do you mean that Dr. Sarton is alive?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, sir, and I believe I know where he is.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Where?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Right there,” said Baley, and pointed firmly at R. Daneel Olivaw.</p>
