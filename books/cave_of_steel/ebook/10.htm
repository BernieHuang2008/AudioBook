<h1 class="chapter2"><img alt="" src="images/Asim_9780307792419_epub_L02_r1.jpg"/></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Baley’s grip tightened convulsively on his fork. “Are you sure?” he asked automatically, and as he said it, he realized the uselessness of the question. You don’t ask a computer if it is sure of the answer it disgorges; not even a computer with arms and legs.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel said, “Quite!”</p>
<p class="indent">“Are they close to us?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Not very. They are scattered.”</p>
<p class="indent">“All right, then.” Baley returned to his meal, his fork moving mechanically. Behind the frown on his long face, his mind worked furiously.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose the incident last night had been organized by a group of anti-robot fanatics, that it had not been the spontaneous trouble it had seemed. Such a group of agitators could easily include men who had studied robots with the intensity born of deep opposition. One of them might have recognized R. Daneel for what he was. (The Commissioner had suggested that, in a way. Damn it, there were surprising depths to that man.)</p>
<p class="indent">It worked itself out logically. Granting they had <a id="page145"/>been unable to act in an organized manner on the spur of last evening’s moment, they would still have been able to plan for the future. If they could recognize a robot such as R. Daneel, they could certainly realize that Baley himself was a police officer. A police officer in the unusual company of a humanoid robot would very likely be a responsible man in the organization. (With the wisdom of hindsight, Baley followed the line of reasoning with no trouble at all.)</p>
<p class="indent">It followed then that observers at City Hall (or perhaps agents within City Hall) would be bound to spot Baley, R. Daneel, or both before too long a time had passed. That they had done so within twenty-four hours was not surprising. They might have done so in less time if so much of Baley’s day had not been spent in Spacetown and along the motorway.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel had finished his meal. He sat quietly waiting, his perfect hands resting lightly on the end of the table.</p>
<p class="indent">“Had we not better do something?” he asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“We’re safe here in the kitchen,” said Baley. “Now leave this to me. Please.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley looked about him cautiously and it was as though he saw a kitchen for the first time.</p>
<p class="indent">People! Thousands of them. What was the capacity of an average kitchen? He had once seen the figure. Two thousand two hundred, he thought. This one was larger than average.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose the cry, “Robot,” were sent out into the air. Suppose it were tossed among the thousands like a …</p>
<p class="indent">He was at a loss for a comparison, but it didn’t matter. It wouldn’t happen.</p>
<p class="indent">A spontaneous riot could flare anywhere, in the kitchens as easily as in the corridors or in the elevators. More easily, perhaps. There was a lack of inhibition at <a id="page146"/>mealtimes, a sense of horseplay that could degenerate into something more serious at a trifle.</p>
<p class="indent">But a planned riot would be different. Here in the kitchen, the planners would themselves be trapped in a large and mob-filled room. Once the dishes went flying and the tables cracking there would be no easy way to escape. Hundreds would certainly die and they themselves might easily be among them.</p>
<p class="indent">No, a safe riot would have to be planned in the avenues of the City, in some relatively narrow passageway. Panic and hysteria would travel slowly along the constriction and there would be time for the quick, prepared fadeaway along the side passage or the unobtrusive step onto an escalating localway that would move them to a higher level and disappearance.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley felt trapped. There were probably others waiting outside. Baley and R. Daneel were to be followed to a proper point and the fuse would be set off.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel said, “Why not arrest them?”</p>
<p class="indent">“That would only start the trouble sooner. You know their faces, don’t you? You won’t forget?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m not capable of forgetting.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Then we’ll nab them another time. For now, we’ll break their net. Follow me. Do exactly as I do.”</p>
<p class="indent">He rose, turned his dish carefully upside down, centering it on the movable disc from below which it had risen. He put his fork back in its recess. R. Daneel, watching, matched his action. The dishes and utensils dropped out of sight.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel said, “They are getting up, too.”</p>
<p class="indent">“All right. It’s my feeling they won’t get too close. Not here.”</p>
<p class="indent">The two moved into line now, drifting toward an exit where the click—click—click of the tags sounded <a id="page147"/>ritualistically, each click recording the expenditure of a ration unit.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley looked back through the steamy haze and the noise and, with incongruous sharpness, thought of a visit to the City Zoo with Ben six or seven years ago. No, eight, because Ben had just passed his eighth birthday then. (Jehoshaphat! Where did the time go?)</p>
<p class="indent">It had been Ben’s first visit and he had been excited. After all, he had never actually seen a cat or a dog before. Then, on top of that, there was the bird cage! Even Baley himself, who had seen it a dozen times before, was not immune to its fascination.</p>
<p class="indent">There is something about the first sight of living objects hurtling through air that is incomparably startling. It was feeding time in the sparrow cage and an attendant was dumping cracked oats into a long trough (human beings had grown used to yeast substitutes, but animals, more conservative in their way, insisted on real grain).</p>
<p class="indent">The sparrows flocked down in what seemed like hundreds. Wing to wing, with an ear-splitting twitter, they lined the trough.…</p>
<p class="indent">That was it; that was the picture that came to Baley’s mind as he looked back at the kitchen he was leaving. Sparrows at the trough. The thought repelled him.</p>
<p class="indent">He thought: Jehoshaphat, there must be a better way.</p>
<p class="indent">But what better way? What was wrong with this way? It had never bothered him before.</p>
<p class="indent">He said abruptly to R. Daneel, “Ready, Daneel?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I am ready, Elijah.”</p>
<p class="indent">They left the kitchen and escape was now clearly and flatly up to Baley.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page148"/>There is a game that youngsters know called “running the strips.” Its rules vary in trivial fashion from City to City, but its essentials are eternal. A boy from San Francisco can join the game in Cairo with no trouble.</p>
<p class="indent">Its object is to get from point A to point B via the City’s rapid transit system in such a way that the “leader” manages to lose as many of his followers as possible. A leader who arrives at the destination alone is skillful indeed, as is a follower who refuses to be shaken.</p>
<p class="indent">The game is usually conducted during the evening rush hour when the increased density of the commuters makes it at once more hazardous and more complicated. The leader sets off, running up and down the accelerating strips. He does his best to do the unexpected, remaining standing on a given strip as long as possible, then leaping off suddenly in either direction. He will run quickly through several strips, then remain waiting once more.</p>
<p class="indent">Pity the follower who incautiously careens forward one strip too far. Before he has caught his mistake, unless he is extraordinarily nimble, he has driven past the leader or fallen behind. The clever leader will compound the error by moving quickly in the appropriate direction.</p>
<p class="indent">A move designed to increase the complexity of the task tenfold involves boarding the localways or the expressways themselves, and hurtling off the other side. It is bad form to avoid them completely and also bad form to linger on them.</p>
<p class="indent">The attraction of the game is not easy for an adult to understand, particularly for an adult who has never himself been a teen-age strip-runner. The players are roughly treated by legitimate travelers into whose path they find themselves inevitably flying. They are <a id="page149"/>persecuted bitterly by the police and punished by their parents. They are denounced in the schools and on the subetherics. No year passes without its four or five teen-agers killed at the game, its dozens hurt, its cases of innocent bystanders meeting tragedy of varying degree.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet nothing can be done to wipe out the strip-running gangs. The greater the danger, the more the strip-runners have that most valuable of all prizes, honor in the eyes of their fellows. A successful one may well swagger; a well-known leader is cock-of-the-walk.</p>
<p class="indent">Elijah Baley, for instance, remembered with satisfaction even now that he had been a strip-runner once. He had led a gang of twenty from the Concourse Sector to the borders of Queens, crossing three expressways. In two tireless and relentless hours, he had shaken off some of the most agile followers of the Bronx, and arrived at the destination point alone. They talked about that run for months.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley was in his forties now, of course. He hadn’t run the strips for over twenty years, but he remembered some of the tricks. What he had lost in agility, he made up in another respect. He was a policeman. No one but another policeman as experienced as himself could possibly know the City as well, know where almost every metal-bordered alley began and ended.</p>
<p class="indent">He walked away from the kitchen briskly, but not too rapidly. Each moment he expected the cry of “Robot, robot” to ring out behind him. That initial set of moments was the riskiest. He counted the steps until he felt the first accelerating strip moving under him.</p>
<p class="indent">He stopped for a moment, while R. Daneel moved smoothly up beside him.</p>
<p class="indent">“Are they still behind us, Daneel?” asked Baley in a whisper.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page150"/>“Yes. They’re moving closer.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That won’t last,” said Baley confidently. He looked at the strips stretching to either side, with their human cargo whipping to his left more and more rapidly as their distance from him increased. He had felt the strips beneath his feet many times a day almost all the days of his life, but he had not bent his knees in anticipation of running them in seven thousand days and more. He felt the old familiar thrill and his breath grew more rapid.</p>
<p class="indent">He quite forgot the one time he had caught Ben at the game. He had lectured him interminably and threatened to have him put under police surveillance.</p>
<p class="indent">Lightly, quickly, at double the “safe” rate, he went up the strips. He leaned forward sharply against the acceleration. The localway was humming past. For a moment, it looked as though he would mount, but suddenly he was fading backward, backward, dodging through the crowd to left and right as it thickened on the slower strips.</p>
<p class="indent">He stopped, and let himself be carried along at a mere fifteen miles an hour.</p>
<p class="indent">“How many are with us, Daneel?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Only one, Elijah.” The robot was at his side, unruffled, unbreathing.</p>
<p class="indent">“He must have been a good one in his day, too, but he won’t last either.”</p>
<p class="indent">Full of self-confidence, he felt a half-remembered sensation of his younger days. It consisted partly of the feeling of immersion in a mystic rite to which others did not belong, partly of the purely physical sensation of wind against hair and face, partly of a tenuous sense of danger.</p>
<p class="indent">“They call this the side shuffle,” he said to R. Daneel in a low voice.</p>
<p class="indent">His long stride ate distance, but he moved along a <a id="page151"/>single strip, dodging the legitimate crowd with a minimum of effort. He kept it up, moving always closer to the strip’s edge, until the steady movement of his head through the crowd must have been hypnotic in its constant velocity—as it was intended to be.</p>
<p class="indent">And then, without a break in his step, he shifted two inches sideways and was on the adjoining strip. He felt an aching in his thigh muscles as he kept his balance.</p>
<p class="indent">He whipped through a cluster of commuters and was on the forty-five-mile strip.</p>
<p class="indent">“How is it now, Daneel?” he asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“He is still with us,” was the calm answer.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley’s lips tightened. There was nothing for it but to use the moving platforms themselves, and that really required coordination; more, perhaps, than he still retained.</p>
<p class="indent">He looked about quickly. Exactly where were they now? B-22d Street flashed by. He made rapid calculations and was off. Up the remaining strips, smoothly and steadily, a swing onto the localway platform.</p>
<p class="indent">The impersonal faces of men and women, calloused with the ennui of way-riding, were jolted into something like indignation as Baley and R. Daneel clambered aboard and squeezed through the railings.</p>
<p class="indent">“Hey, now,” called a woman shrilly, clutching at her hat.</p>
<p class="indent">“Sorry,” said Baley, breathlessly.</p>
<p class="indent">He forced his way through the standees and with a wriggle was off on the other side. At the last moment, a jostled passenger thumped his back in anger. He went staggering.</p>
<p class="indent">Desperately he tried to regain his footing. He lurched across a strip boundary and the sudden <a id="page152"/>change in velocity forced him to his knees and then over to his side.</p>
<p class="indent">He had the sudden, panicky vision of men colliding with him and bowling over, of a spreading confusion on the strips, one of the dreaded “man-jams” that would not fail to put dozens in the hospital with broken limbs.</p>
<p class="indent">But R. Daneel’s arm was under his back. He felt himself lifted with more than a man’s strength.</p>
<p class="indent">“Thanks,” gasped Baley, and there was no time for more.</p>
<p class="indent">Off he went and down the decelerating strips in a complicated pattern so designed that his feet met the V-joint strips of an expressway at the exact point of crossover. Without the loss of rhythm, he was accelerating again, then up and over an expressway.</p>
<p class="indent">“Is he with us, Daneel?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Not one in sight, Elijah.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Good. But what a strip-runner you would have been, Daneel!—Oops, now, now!”</p>
<p class="indent">Off into another localway in a whirl and down the strips with a clatter to a doorway, large and official in appearance. A guard rose to his feet.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley flashed his identification. “Official business.”</p>
<p class="indent">They were inside.</p>
<p class="indent">“Power plant,” said Baley, curtly. “This breaks our tracks completely.”</p>
<p class="indent">He had been in power plants before, including this one. Familiarity did not lessen his feelings of uncomfortable awe. The feeling was heightened by the haunting thought that once his father had been high in the hierarchy of a plant such as this. That is, before …</p>
<p class="indent">There was the surrounding hum of the tremendous generators hidden in the central well of the <a id="page153"/>plant, the faint sharpness of ozone in the air, the grim and silent threat of the red lines that marked the limits beyond which no one could pass without protective clothing.</p>
<p class="indent">Somewhere in the plant (Baley had no idea exactly where) a pound of fissionable material was consumed each day. Every so often, the radioactive fission products, the so-called “hot ash,” were forced by air pressure through leaden pipes to distant caverns ten miles out in the ocean and a half mile below the ocean floor. Baley sometimes wondered what would happen when the caverns were filled.</p>
<p class="indent">He said to R. Daneel with sudden gruffness, “Stay away from the red lines.” Then, he bethought himself and added sheepishly, “But I suppose it doesn’t matter to you.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Is it a question of radioactivity?” asked Daneel.</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Then it does matter to me. Gamma radiation destroys the delicate balance of a positronic brain. It would affect me much sooner than it would affect you.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You mean it would <em>kill</em> you?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I would require a new positronic brain. Since no two can be alike, I would be a new individual. The Daneel you now speak to would be, in a manner of speaking, dead.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley looked at the other doubtfully. “I never knew that.—Up these ramps.”</p>
<p class="indent">“The point isn’t stressed. Spacetown wishes to convince Earthmen of the usefulness of such as myself, not of our weaknesses.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Then why tell me?”</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel turned his eyes full on his human companion. “You are my partner, Elijah. It is well that you know my weaknesses and shortcomings.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page154"/>Baley cleared his throat and had nothing more to say on the subject.</p>
<p class="indent">“Out in this direction,” he said a moment later, “and we’re a quarter of a mile from our apartment.”</p>
<p class="extract">   It was a grim, lower-class apartment. One small room and two beds. Two fold-in chairs and a closet. A built-in subetheric screen that allowed no manual adjustment, and would be working only at stated hours, but <em>would</em> be working then. No washbasin, not even an unactivated one, and no facilities for cooking or even boiling water. A small trash-disposal pipe was in one corner of the room, an ugly, unadorned, unpleasantly functional object.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley shrugged. “This is it. I guess we can stand it.”</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel walked to the trash-disposal pipe. His shirt unseamed at a touch, revealing a smooth and, to all appearances, well-muscled chest.</p>
<p class="indent">“What are you doing?” asked Baley.</p>
<p class="indent">“Getting rid of the food I ingested. If I were to leave it, it would putrefy and I would become an object of distaste.”</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel placed two fingers carefully under one nipple and pushed in a definite pattern of pressure. His chest opened longitudinally. R. Daneel reached in and from a welter of gleaming metal withdrew a thin, translucent sac, partly distended. He opened it while Baley watched with a kind of horror.</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel hesitated. He said, “The food is perfectly clean. I do not salivate or chew. It was drawn in through the gullet by suction, you know. It is edible.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s all right,” said Baley, gently. “I’m not hungry. You just get rid of it.”</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel’s food sac was of fluorocarbon plastic, Baley decided. At least the food did not cling to it. It <a id="page155"/>came out smoothly and was placed little by little into the pipe. A waste of good food at that, he thought.</p>
<p class="indent">He sat down on one bed and removed his shirt. He said, “I suggest an early start tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="indent">“For a specific reason?”</p>
<p class="indent">“The location of this apartment isn’t known to our friends yet. Or at least I hope not. If we leave early, we are that much safer. Once in City Hall, we will have to decide whether our partnership is any longer practical.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You think it is perhaps not?” Baley shrugged and said dourly, “We can’t go through this sort of thing every day.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But it seems to me—”</p>
<p class="indent">R. Daneel was interrupted by the sharp scarlet sliver of the door signal.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley rose silently to his feet and unlimbered his blaster. The door signal flashed once more.</p>
<p class="indent">He moved silently to the door, put his thumb on the blaster contact while he threw the switch that activated the one-way transparency patch. It wasn’t a good view-patch; it was small and had a distorting effect, but it was quite good enough to show Baley’s youngster, Ben, outside the door.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley acted quickly. He flung the door open, snatched brutally at Ben’s wrist as the boy raised his hand to signal a third time, and pulled him in.</p>
<p class="indent">The look of fright and bewilderment faded only slowly from Ben’s eyes as he leaned breathlessly against the wall toward which he had been hurled. He rubbed his wrist.</p>
<p class="indent">“Dad!” he said in grieved tones. “You didn’t have to grab me like that.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley was staring through the view-patch of the once-again-closed door. As nearly as he could tell, the corridor was empty.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page156"/>“Did you see anyone out there, Ben?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. Gee, Dad, I just came to see if you were all right.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Why shouldn’t I be all right?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t know. It was Mom. She was crying and all like that. She said I had to find you. If I didn’t go, she said she would go herself, and then she didn’t know what would happen. She <em>made</em> me go, Dad.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley said, “How did you find me? Did your mother know where I was?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No, she didn’t. I called up your office.”</p>
<p class="indent">“And they told you?”</p>
<p class="indent">Ben looked startled at his father’s vehemence. He said, in a low voice, “Sure. Weren’t they supposed to?”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley and Daneel looked at one another.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley rose heavily to his feet. He said, “Where’s your mother now, Ben? At the apartment?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No, we went to Grandma’s for dinner and stayed there. I’m supposed to go back there now. I mean, as long as you’re all right, Dad.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You’ll stay here. Daneel, did you notice the exact location of the floor communo?”</p>
<p class="indent">The robot said, “Yes. Do you intend leaving the room to use it?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’ve got to. I’ve got to get in touch with Jessie.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Might I suggest that it would be more logical to let Bentley do that. It is a form of risk and he is less valuable.”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley stared. “Why you—”</p>
<p class="indent">He thought: Jehoshaphat, what am I getting angry about?</p>
<p class="indent">He went on more calmly, “You don’t understand, Daneel. Among us, it is not customary for a man to send his young son into possible danger, even if it is logical to do so.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page157"/>“Danger!” squeaked Ben in a sort of horrified pleasure. “What’s going on, Dad? Huh, Dad?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Nothing, Ben. Now, this isn’t any of your business. Understand? Get ready for bed. I want you in bed when I get back. You hear me?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Aw, gosh. You could tell a fellow. I won’t say anything.”</p>
<p class="indent">“In bed!”</p>
<p class="indent">“Gosh!”</p>
<p class="extract">   Baley hitched his jacket back as he stood at the floor communo, so that his blaster butt was ready for snatching. He spoke his personal number into the mouthpiece and waited while a computer fifteen miles away checked it to make sure the call was permissible. It was a very short wait that was involved, since a plain-clothes man had no limit on the number of his business calls. He spoke the code number of his mother-in-law’s apartment.</p>
<p class="indent">The small screen at the base of the instrument lit up, and her face looked out at him.</p>
<p class="indent">He said, in a low voice, “Mother, put on Jessie.”</p>
<p class="indent">Jessie must have been waiting for him. She was on at once. Baley looked at her face and then darkened the screen deliberately.</p>
<p class="indent">“All right, Jessie. Ben’s here. Now, what’s the matter?” His eyes roved from side to side continuously, watching.</p>
<p class="indent">“Are you all right? You aren’t in trouble?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m obviously all right, Jessie. Now stop it.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Oh, Lije, I’ve been so worried.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What about?” he asked tightly.</p>
<p class="indent">“You know. Your friend.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What about him?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I told you last night. There’ll be trouble.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page158"/>“Now, that’s nonsense. I’m keeping Ben with me for tonight and you go to bed. Good-by, dear.”</p>
<p class="indent">He broke connections and waited for two breaths before starting back. His face was gray with apprehension and fear.</p>
<p class="indent">Ben was standing in the middle of the room when Baley returned. One of his contact lenses was neatly pocketed in a little suction cup. The other was still in his eye.</p>
<p class="indent">Ben said, “Gosh, Dad, isn’t there any water in this place? Mr. Olivaw says I can’t go to the Personal.”</p>
<p class="indent">“He’s right. You can’t. Put that thing back in your eye, Ben. It won’t hurt you to sleep with them for one night.”</p>
<p class="indent">“All right.” Ben put it back, put away his suction cup and climbed into bed. “Boy, what a mattress!”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley said to R. Daneel, “I suppose you won’t mind sitting up.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Of course not. I was interested, by the way, in the queer glass Bentley wears close to his eyes. Do all Earthmen wear them?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. Just some,” said Baley, absently. “I don’t, for instance.”</p>
<p class="indent">“For what reason is it worn?”</p>
<p class="indent">Baley was too absorbed with his own thoughts to answer. His own uneasy thoughts.</p>
<p class="extract">   The lights were out.</p>
<p class="indent">Baley remained wakeful. He was dimly aware of Ben’s breathing as it turned deep and regular and became a bit rough. When he turned his head, he grew somehow conscious of R. Daneel, sitting in a chair with grave immobility, face turned toward the door.</p>
<p class="indent">Then he fell asleep, and when he slept, he dreamed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page159"/>He dreamed Jessie was falling into the fission chamber of a nuclear power plant, falling and falling. She held out her arms to him, shrieking, but he could only stand frozenly just outside a scarlet line and watch her distorted figure turn as it fell, growing smaller until it was only a dot.</p>
<p class="indent">He could only watch her, in the dream, knowing that it was he, himself, who had pushed her.</p>
